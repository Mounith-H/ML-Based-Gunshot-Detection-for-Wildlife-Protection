## Building and Running
### Prerequisites
1. Install CMake (version 3.12 or higher)
2. Install Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
3. Set PICO_SDK_PATH environment variable

### Build Instructions
1. Create build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

2. Generate build files:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Flash the binary:
   - Hold BOOTSEL button while connecting Pico
   - Copy generated .uf2 file to mounted drive

### Power Management Notes
- The system uses PIO-based power control for the IP5306
- KEY pin requires continuous pulsing to maintain power
- PWM implementation ensures reliable operation
- No manual intervention needed after initial power-up
